# EV Outlook 2025 Dataset

## Introduction

The International Energy Agency's (IEA) Global EV Outlook 2025 dataset provides comprehensive data on electric vehicle (EV) adoption worldwide. The dataset includes historical data from 2015 to 2024 and projections up to 2030, offering insights into the evolution of the EV market under the IEA's Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS). This scenario assumes no new policies beyond those already implemented by early 2025.

## Dataset Overview

### Structure and Scope

The dataset is organized into 8 columns:

- **Region**: Identifies the geographical region or country (e.g., China, Europe, Asia Pacific, USA, India).
- **Category**: Differentiates between historical data and projections (Projection-STEPS).
- **Parameter**: Specifies the metric being measured (e.g., EV stock, EV sales, EV stock share, EV sales share, charging infrastructure).
- **Mode**: Categorizes vehicle types (e.g., cars, 2 and 3 wheelers, vans, trucks, buses).
- **Powertrain**: Identifies the propulsion technology (e.g., BEV, PHEV, EV).
- **Year**: Covers the temporal range from 2015 to 2030.
- **Unit**: Clarifies the unit of measurement (e.g., vehicles, percent, charging points).
- **Value**: Contains the numeric data corresponding to the parameter.
- **Aggregate group**: Categorizes data for regional and thematic analysis (e.g., World, Aggregate_sales_stock, Other).

## Key Terms and Concepts

- **EV Stock**: Total number of electric vehicles in operation in a given year.
- **EV Sales**: Annual number of new electric vehicles sold.
- **EV Stock Share / EV Sales Share**: Percentage of EVs relative to total vehicle stock or sales.
- **Powertrain Types**: BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles), PHEVs (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles), and EVs (encompassing all electric vehicles).
- **Modes**: Vehicle categories such as cars, 2 and 3 wheelers, vans, trucks, and buses.
- **Aggregate Groups**: Data grouped by regions (e.g., World, Asia Pacific, Other) for comparative analysis.

## Variable Analysis

### Region/Country

The dataset covers major global regions, including China, Europe, Asia Pacific, the USA, and India. China is a significant player in EV production and sales, driven by strong government policies, subsidies, and a robust manufacturing ecosystem. Europe and the USA also show significant EV adoption, with emerging markets in Asia Pacific and India.

### Category (Historical vs. Projection-STEPS)

The dataset distinguishes between historical data (actual past values) and projections under the IEA's Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS). STEPS assumes no new policies beyond those implemented by early 2025, providing a conservative yet policy-informed outlook.

### Parameter

The dataset tracks multiple parameters critical to EV market analysis:

- **EV Stock and EV Sales**: Fundamental metrics for understanding market size and growth.
- **EV Stock Share and EV Sales Share**: Indicators of market electrification progress.
- **Charging Infrastructure**: Number of charging points, essential for supporting EV adoption.
- **Oil Displacement and CO2 Emissions**: Environmental impact metrics.
- **Battery Demand**: Reflects the growing need for batteries as EV adoption increases.

### Mode

Vehicle modes include cars, 2 and 3 wheelers, vans, trucks, and buses. The dataset highlights the diversity of EV adoption across different vehicle segments.

### Powertrain

The powertrain column differentiates between BEVs, PHEVs, and general EVs. BEVs are fully electric, PHEVs combine electric and internal combustion propulsion, and EVs encompass all electric vehicles.

### Year

The dataset covers the years from 2015 to 2030, enabling year-over-year trend analysis and projection comparisons.

### Unit

Units include vehicles (for stock and sales), percent (for shares), and charging points (for infrastructure).

### Value

The value column contains the numeric data for analysis, reflecting the scale of EV adoption and infrastructure development globally.

### Aggregate Group

Aggregate groups categorize data for regional and thematic analysis, facilitating comparative studies and regional benchmarking.

## Contextual Background

### Global EV Market Trends

The dataset reflects the rapid growth of the global EV market, with projections indicating significant increases in EV stock and sales by 2030. China is expected to continue dominating the market, with strong government support and a robust manufacturing ecosystem.

### Regional Dynamics

- **China**: Dominates EV production and sales, with strong government subsidies and local manufacturing.
- **Europe**: EV adoption is driven by EU CO2 emission standards and the phase-out of internal combustion engines by 2035.
- **USA**: Federal and state-level policies support EV growth.
- **India and Asia Pacific**: Rapid growth in 2 and 3 wheelers and affordable EV models.
- **Rest of the World**: Emerging markets show growing interest in EVs, despite challenges such as lack of charging infrastructure and high upfront costs.

### Technological and Infrastructure Developments

Advancements in battery technology and charging networks are critical enablers of EV adoption. The dataset reflects the expanding charging infrastructure, with China and Europe leading in public charger deployment.

### Policy and Regulatory Landscape

Key policies influencing EV adoption include subsidies, tax incentives, ICE phase-outs, and emissions standards. The IEA's STEPS scenario reflects the impact of these policies on market projections.
